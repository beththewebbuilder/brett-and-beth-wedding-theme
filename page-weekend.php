        We are gathering our closest family and friends for a quiet, relaxed wedding weekend at Tonedale House. It will be a chance to slow down, spend proper time together, and celebrate our marriage in a relaxed and unhurried way.
    </p>
    <p>A couple weeks later on <strong>Saturday 20th June</strong>, we will be hosting an evening of drinks, dancing, and cake, to mark our marriage with a wider group of guests. We would be delighted if you could join us again.</p>
    <p>
        Below you'll find everything you need to know, along with the RSVP to let us know which parts you'll be joining us for.
